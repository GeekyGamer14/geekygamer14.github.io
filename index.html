          <p>
            Some stuff I've worked on over the years. This is only a few of my projects,
            you can find all the rest on <a href="https://github.com/tjhorner" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.srnd.companion" class="strong" target="_blank">CodeDay Companion</a>:
            A native Android app written in Kotlin to provide useful and contextually relevant data
            to CodeDay attendees before, during, and after the event. Source code will be released
            eventually.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tjhorner/MakerbotWebUI" class="strong" target="_blank">MakerBot WebUI</a>:
            A Node.js web app that acts as a MakerBot 3D printer controller. It's targeted toward
            public spaces such as college campuses or makerspaces that have public 3D printers. It
            lets users sign up on their own and queue their own prints. Basically, it eliminates
            the need for someone onsite to manually queue prints.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tjhorner/node-makerbot-rpc" class="strong" target="_blank">node-makerbot-rpc</a>:
            A node module that communicates with MakerBot 3D printers via JSON-RPC. Supports things
            like uploading print files and basic functionality. Useful for automation. Also used
            in the MakerBot WebUI project :)

          <h2 class="color-yellow">Security</h2>

          <p>
            In my free time, I like poking websites for security vulnerabilities. And, of course,
            I disclose them responsibly. Here's what I've found.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Environment Variable Leak</strong> on <a href="https://npmjs.com" class="strong" target="_blank">npm</a>:
            Found a vulnerability in the npm internal API that leaked environment variables, including API keys
            and database passwords (I shit you not, their Redis password used to be
            this-is-a-password-for-redis-and-it-is-a-secret-so-dont-share-it), on certain requests.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cross-Site-Scripting</strong> on <a href="https://www.gotomeeting.com/" class="strong" target="_blank">GoToMeeting</a>:
            Angular statements put into meeting chat were not properly escaped, and executed on all clients whether
            they had the chat open or not. This allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript on all clients
            in the meeting.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cross-Site-Scripting</strong> on <a href="https://www.transifex.com/" class="strong" target="_blank">Transifex</a>:
            HTML not escaped properly in Glossary and Updates views from the Translate page, allowing an attacker
            to execute arbitrary JavaScript on a client viewing a certain translation.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cross-Site Scripting</strong> and <strong>Privilege Escalation</strong> on <a href="https://school.bighistoryproject.com/" class="strong" target="_blank">Big History Project</a>:
            When updating a user's profile, one could send arbitrary data to the server in the name fields,
            and that is later shown on the website but isn't escaped, so you could put anything you want in
            there. It is also shown and effective in the teacher's dashboard, so a student could technically
            just XSS a teacher.

            <br><br>

            A certain exploit allows a student to gain access to the teacher dashboard, and do everything a
            teacher can do (enable tests/quizzes, view student scores, add/delete/edit students and classes,
            etc.) This is obviously really bad.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cross-Site-Scripting</strong> on <a href="http://www.lenovosoftware.com/unified-workspace" class="strong" target="_blank">Lenovo Unified Workspace</a>:
            An exploit in how wallpapers on Unified Workspace works allows a user to input arbitrary JavaScript,
            which is later not escaped properly when loading the workspace dashboard, and is then evaluated in a
            script.
